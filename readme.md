# ðŸŽ¬ Cinematrix - UPdate

**Note :** This project, Cinematrix, was an experimental attempt where I explored full-stack development with features like watchlists, user reviews, and more.

I started this project with big ideas and a lot of energy, and along the way, I faced some real-world development challengesâ€”especially around database design, relationships, and project planning.

Due to weak initial planning and an undercooked database structure, the project started hitting roadblocks that slowed down development. Iâ€™ve decided to pause work on Cinematrix for now rather than patch things up the wrong way.

This repo remains up as a learning archive of sortsâ€”because through all the issues, I ended up learning a ton about backend logic, authentication, relationships, and what not to do in a MERN stack app.

Iâ€™ll be back with a better plan and a stronger architecture next time.
